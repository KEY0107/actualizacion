        <p>My favorite genres of music</p>

        <dl>
            <dt>Rock</dt>
            <dd>Rock is known as a set of varied genres of popular music, descendants more or less of the original Rock n' Roll born in the United States in the 1950s, as the result of a fusion between Country music and Rhythm and Blues.

            Typically, Rock is a genre recognized for the predominance of the electric guitar, with songs in 4/4 time and a verse-chorus structure. But in its particular evolution it is difficult today to find really common characteristics.</dd>
            
            <dt>Metal</dt>
            <dd>Metal is a musical genre derived from Hard Rock, Acid Rock and Blues. It also incorporates characteristic elements of classical music. Metal is characterized by the use of distorted guitars, robust basses and versatile drums, all of this together to create a powerful, rhythmic and strident sound.
            The use of energetic guitar riffs, marked rhythms and dynamic solos, mostly complex, fast and versatile, are the basis for the composition of the songs of this genre. The vocal work of metal singers should not be left aside, since their characteristic tone, sometimes high register and with thunderous screams, in addition to lyrics with mystical topics and taboos mark the roughness and crudeness of the Metal melody by excellence.
            An infinity of subgenres have emerged from metal, always with the aforementioned characteristic elements, also adding characteristic variations that make them worthy of having a separate name.</dd>

            <dt>Pop</dt>
            <dd>Pop music is a musical style derived from popular music. Its name, pop, comes from English, which is a shortening of the popular term, which in Spanish translates 'popular'.
            Pop music originates in England, in the middle of the 20th century, taking elements from different genres of popular music at the time. In this sense, it is a very eclectic genre, because in it you can trace elements of rock and roll, dance, gospel, soul, folk, as well as more current genres of African-American music, such as rap or hip hop.
            Some of the fundamental characteristics of pop music are the short duration of its songs, the verse-chorus-verse structure of its lyrical compositions, and its catchy rhythms and choruses.</dd>
